# Progress Telerik Report Viewer component for Angular

This package is part of [Telerik Reporting](https://www.telerik.com/reporting).

This Angular component is a report viewer that will ensure straightforward embedding of reports for preview.
The viewer is built as a wrapper of the Telerik Reporting HTML5 Report Viewer widget,
inheriting all its strengths, including:

* Navigate the report pages for preview on the screen

* Exercise the defined interactivities like navigate to another report or to a bookmark in the same one,
drill-down or sort on a column, etc.

* Print or export the report to all the formats we support, including PDF and Excel

While the component is not native (the theming mechanism uses Kendo UI for jQuery
and has a dependency to jQuery itself), it brings reporting value to your Angular applications
in no time.

This version of the Angular Report Viewer requires Telerik Report Server or Telerik Reporting REST Service 19.0.25.313.
